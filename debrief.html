  <h2>Study Title:</h2>
  <p>User Evaluation of an Online Gambling Platform</p>

  <h2>Thank you for taking part in this study.</h2>
  <p>We would now like to explain the true purpose of the study, which involved a mild form of deception.</p>

  <h2>What was the study really about?</h2>
  <p>
    Although you were told the aim was to evaluate a new online slot machine interface, the actual focus of the study was how people interact with cookie consent banners in gambling-like environments.
    We are interested in how the design of cookie banners influences user decisions (e.g. whether to accept or reject data tracking), especially in contexts that might reduce user attention or critical thinking.
  </p>

  <h2>Why was deception used?</h2>
  <p>
    If we had explained the true aim upfront, participants might have paid more attention to the cookie banner than they normally would. That would have biased the results and made it difficult to study natural behaviour.
    Deception was used solely to observe your interaction with the banner without influencing it. This approach follows ethical guidance for behavioural research where full transparency would undermine the scientific validity of the task.
  </p>

  <h2>What data was collected?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>How you interacted with the cookie banner (e.g. clicks, timing, choices)</li>
    <li>Your answers to the survey questions before and after the experiment</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    All data is anonymised and stored securely. Your Prolific ID is stored separately from any behavioural data.
  </p>

  <h2>What happens next?</h2>
  <p>
    Your participation will help us better understand how design features influence data consent decisions in online gambling settings. The findings may support future recommendations on digital privacy and user protection.
  </p>
  <p>
    You have the right to withdraw your data now that the true purpose has been revealed. To do so, please email <a href="mailto:2332964@swansea.ac.uk">2332964@swansea.ac.uk</a> within 14 days of your participation and include your Prolific ID so we can locate your data. No explanation is required.
  </p>
