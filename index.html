  <h1>Participant Information Sheet</h1>
  <h2>Title of Research:</h2>
  <p><strong>User Behaviour on Online Gambling Platforms</strong></p>

  <p>You are being invited to take part in some research. Before you decide whether to participate, it is important for you to understand why the research is being conducted and what it will involve. Please read the following information carefully.</p>

  <h3>What is the purpose of the research?</h3>
  <p>We are conducting research on how users interact with online gambling platforms. The purpose of this study is to better understand how certain design elements affect user decisions and behaviour.</p>

  <h3>Who is carrying out the research?</h3>
  <p>The data are being collected by Jack McGarrigle, a PhD researcher in the Department of Psychology, Faculty of Medicine, Health and Life Science, Swansea University. The research has been approved by the Faculty of Medicine, Health and Life Science Research Ethics Committee.</p>

  <h3>What happens if I agree to take part?</h3>
  <p>Firstly, you will be asked to complete the Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI)</p>  
  <p>You will be then be asked to interact with a simulated online gambling platform. There is no real money involved. We will record the following information:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your choices during the task</li>
    <li>How you interact with on-screen elements (e.g. clicks, navigation)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You will also be asked for brief demographic information (e.g. age, gender, and gambling habits).</p>

  <h3>Are there any risks associated with taking part?</h3>
  <p>There are no significant risks associated with participation. However, if you are uncomfortable with gambling-related content, you may choose not to take part.</p>

  <h3>Data Protection and Confidentiality</h3>
  <p>Your data will be processed in accordance with the Data Protection Act 2018 and the UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). All information collected about you will be kept strictly confidential and only viewed by the research team.</p>
  <p>All electronic data will be stored on a password-protected file on Swansea University’s OneDrive system. Consent forms will be stored separately from your behavioural data. No paper records will be created.</p>
  <p><strong>Please note:</strong> the data we will collect for our study will be made anonymous immediately after participation. Therefore, once you have completed the study, it will not be possible to identify or remove your data. If you wish to withdraw your data, please do so <strong>before leaving the task</strong>.</p>
  <p><strong>Note on online participation:</strong> as data will be submitted via an online platform, you will be unable to withdraw your data after submission.</p>

  <h3>What will happen to the information I provide?</h3>
  <p>The data will be analysed and may be included in academic presentations, scientific publications, or other research outputs. All information presented will be anonymised and unidentifiable.</p>

  <h3>Is participation voluntary and what if I wish to later withdraw?</h3>
  <p>Your participation is entirely voluntary. You can withdraw from the study at any time without giving a reason. However, once the data has been anonymised (immediately upon submission), it cannot be withdrawn.</p>
