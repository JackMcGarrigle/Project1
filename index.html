  <h2>Title of Research:</h2>
  <p><strong>User Behaviour on Online Gambling Platforms</strong></p>

  <p>Thank you for your interest in this research study! Before you decide whether to participate, it is important for you to understand why the research is being conducted and what it will involve. Please read the following information carefully.</p>

  <h3>What is the purpose of the research?</h3>
  <p>We are conducting research on how users interact with online gambling platforms. The purpose of this study is to better understand how certain design elements affect user decisions and behaviour.</p>

  <h3>Who is carrying out the research?</h3>
  <p>The data are being collected by Jack McGarrigle, a PhD researcher in the School of Psychology, Swansea University, supervised by Professor Simon Dymond, School of Psychology, Swansea University.

  <h3>What happens if I agree to take part?</h3>
  <p>Firstly, you will be asked to complete the Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI)</p>  
  <p>You will be then be asked to interact with a simulated online gambling platform. There is no real money involved. We will record the following information:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your choices during the task</li>
    <li>How you interact with on-screen elements (e.g. clicks, navigation)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You will also be asked some questions after interacting with the online gambling platform.</p>

  <h3>Are there any risks associated with taking part?</h3>
  <p>There are no significant risks associated with participation. However, if you are uncomfortable with gambling-related content, you may choose not to take part.</p>

  <h3>Data Protection and Confidentiality</h3>

  <p>Please note:the data we will collect for our study will be made anonymous immediately after participation. Therefore, once you have completed the study, it will not be possible to identify or remove your data. If you wish to withdraw your data, please do so before leaving the task.</p>
  <p>Note on online participation:as data will be submitted via an online platform, you will be unable to withdraw your data after submission.</p>

  <h3>What will happen to the information I provide?</h3>
  <p>An analysis of the information will form part of our report at the end of the study and may be presented to interested parties and published in scientific journals and related media.  Note that all information presented in any reports or publications will be anonymous and unidentifiable. /p>

  <h3>Is participation voluntary and what if I wish to later withdraw?</h3>
  <p>Your participation is entirely voluntary – you do not have to participate if you do not want to.  If you decide to participate, but later wish to withdraw from the study, then you are free to withdraw at any time, without giving a reason and without penalty.
