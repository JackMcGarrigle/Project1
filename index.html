  <h1>Participant Information Sheet</h1>
  <h2>Title of Research:</h2>
  <p><strong>User Behaviour on Online Gambling Platforms</strong></p>

  <p>You are being invited to take part in a research study on user behaviour on online gambling platforms. Before you decide whether to participate, it is important for you to understand why the research is being conducted and what it will involve. Please read the following information carefully.</p>

  <h3>What is the purpose of the research?</h3>
  <p>We are conducting research on how users interact with online gambling platforms. The purpose of this study is to better understand how certain design elements affect user decisions and behaviour. Your participation in this study will take approximately 5 minutes.</p>

  <h3>Who is carrying out the research?</h3>
  <p>The data are being collected by Jack McGarrigle, a PhD researcher in the School of Psychology, Swansea University, supervised by Professor Simon Dymond, School of Psychology, Swansea University. (((The study has been approved by the School of Psychology Research Ethics Committee within the Faculty of Medicine, Health and Life Science))).</p>

 <h3>Who can take part in this study?</h3>
  <p>You can take part if you are over 18 and currently live in the UK. You cannot take part if you are under 18 or if you are currently receiving treatment for problem gambling.</p>

 <h3>What happens if I agree to take part?</h3>
  <p>Firstly, you will be asked to complete the Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI)</p>  
  <p>You will be then be asked to interact with a simulated online gambling platform. There is no real money involved. We will record the following information:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your choices during the task</li>
    <li>How you interact with on-screen elements (e.g. clicks, navigation)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You will also be asked some questions after interacting with the online gambling platform.</p>

  <h3>Are there any risks associated with taking part?</h3>
  <p>This research has been approved by the Faculty of Medicine, Health and Life Sciences Research Ethics Committee. There are no significant risks associated with participation. However, if you are uncomfortable with gambling-related content, you may choose not to take part.</p>

  <h3>Data Protection and Confidentiality</h3>
  <p>Your data will be processed in accordance with the Data Protection Act 2018 and the UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). All information collected about you will be kept strictly confidential. Your data will only be viewed by the researcher/research team.</p>
  <p>All electronic data will be stored on a password-protected file on Swansea University’s OneDrive system. All paper records will be stored in a locked filing cabinet at Swansea University. Your consent information will be kept separately from your responses to minimise risk in the event of a data breach.</p>
  <p>Please note that the data we will collect for our study will be made anonymous immediately after participation. Thus, it will not be possible to identify and remove your data at a later date, should you decide to withdraw from the study. Therefore, if at the end of this research you decide to have your data withdrawn, please do so before leaving the task.</p>
  <p>Please note that as data is being collected online, once the data has been submitted you will be unable to withdraw your information.</p>

  <h3>What will happen to the information I provide?</h3>
  <p>An analysis of the information will form part of our report at the end of the study and may be presented to interested parties and published in scientific journals and related media.  Note that all information presented in any reports or publications will be anonymous and unidentifiable. /p>

  <h3>Is participation voluntary and what if I wish to later withdraw?</h3>
  <p>Your participation is entirely voluntary – you do not have to participate if you do not want to.  If you decide to participate, but later wish to withdraw from the study, then you are free to withdraw at any time, without giving a reason and without penalty. But please note that the research data you have provided cannot be disaggregated after anonymisation/p>
